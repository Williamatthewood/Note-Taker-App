# Note Taker Starter Code

## Description
The Note Taker app is a simple implementation of express.js. Users have a simple interface for titling and writing new notes and saving them to the database file. 


## Usage

Users simply start typing a new note, ensuring it has a title and note body. They can then click the save button to add it to the list on the left-hand side. Saved notes are stored persistently, so the user can view them again simply by clicking on them in the list, and their data will be pulled from the data base file. You can delete any notes from the application and database by simply clicking the delete button next to any note.
